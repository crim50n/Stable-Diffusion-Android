    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
        crims0n built the Pocket Diffusion app as a Free and Open Source app.
        This SERVICE is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.
    </p>

    <p>
        This page is used to inform visitors regarding policies with the collection,
        use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use this Service.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

    <p>
        Pocket Diffusion does not collect any personal information. All image generation
        happens either on your device locally or on servers you configure yourself.
        We do not have access to your prompts, images, or any other data.
    </p>

    <p>
        The app may connect to third-party servers (such as Automatic1111, ComfyUI, etc.)
        that you configure. The privacy policies of those services apply to data sent to them.
    </p>

    <h2>On-Device Generation</h2>

    <p>
        When using on-device generation (MediaPipe), all processing happens locally on your
        Android device. No data is sent to any external servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Log Data</h2>

    <p>
        The app may create local log files on your device for debugging purposes.
        These logs are stored only on your device and are not transmitted anywhere.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>
        The FOSS version of the app does not include any third-party analytics or tracking services.
    </p>

    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

    <p>
        This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link,
        you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us.
        Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>
        These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
        personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review
        this page periodically for any changes.
    </p>

    <p>This policy is effective as of 2026-01-01</p>
